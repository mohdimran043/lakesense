# LakeSense — Build Progress

> Source of truth for resumability. Canonical requirements: `lakesense-final-prompt.md` (v2).
> Protocol: read this file + `git log --oneline -5` on every session start, resume from **Next Action**.
> Prior history note: commits before `8ad0481` used the v1 prompt's phase numbering — ignore their numbering; v2 (this file) governs.

## Phase 0 — Workspace Setup
- [x] Project structure created (engine/, backend/, frontend/, website/, deploy/, docs/, docs-site/, scripts/, reference/)
- [x] git repo + .gitignore (reference/, .env, node_modules/, Go+Node build artifacts, .claude local)
- [x] Reference clones: `reference/olake`, `reference/olake-ui` (shallow, read-only, gitignored)
- [x] Initial PROGRESS.md with every phase/task — this file

## Phase 1 — Reference Analysis (clean-room bridge)
> These docs are the ONLY channel reference→LakeSense. Own words, concepts only, never code listings.
- [x] docs/analysis/engine-protocol.md — connector lifecycle, config/state JSON shapes, stream selection
- [x] docs/analysis/postgres-connector.md — chunking (CTID/keyset), pgoutput CDC, resume, type mapping
- [x] docs/analysis/mysql-connector.md — binlog CDC, snapshot+position coordination, gotchas
- [x] docs/analysis/other-sources.md — MongoDB, MSSQL, Oracle, DB2, Kafka, S3 (concept level)
- [x] docs/analysis/writers.md — Parquet, Iceberg commit flow, Java layer rationale, pure-Go alternatives
- [x] docs/analysis/state-and-recovery.md — resumable syncs, exactly-once-ish delivery
- [x] docs/analysis/control-plane.md — job/source/destination models, orchestration
- [x] [BRAINSTORM] Iceberg write strategy → DECIDED: Option C (see Decisions Log)
- [x] Close reference/ for engine build (re-open only via analysis-doc updates) — CLOSED 2026-07-19

## Phase 2 — LakeSense Engine
> Build order strictly: Tier A → A-Compatible → B → C. Badge = battery actually passed (code, not prose).
- [x] 2.1 Engine skeleton: lsengine CLI (spec/check/discover/sync/backfill/verify), JSON config/state I/O (atomic saves), JSONL event schema v1 in engine/internal/events (designed ONCE — envelope + 16 kinds + typed payloads); make check green (lint 0 issues, -race tests pass)
- [x] 2.2 Connector SDK: sdk.Connector + FullLoader/IncrementalReader/ChangeStreamer facets, capability declarations enforced in code (ValidateCapabilities), presets for wire-compatible variants, registry; model (lake types incl. decimal, two-layer catalog + validation); state (chunk-set protocol, cursors, global CDC anchor, atomic persist). make check green.
- [x] 2.3 Postgres connector (Tier A): CTID+keyset full load, incremental cursor, **pgoutput CDC** (ChangeStreamer: auto slot/publication, wal_level guard, ack-before-state slot discipline, TOAST-unavailable sentinel instead of silent null, resume). Unit tests + env-gated integration suite (`LAKESENSE_PG_IT=1`) green: check/discover, full-load exactly-once across chunks, incremental past-cursor, **end-to-end CDC insert/update/delete + resume**. make check 0 issues, -race clean.
- [x] 2.x Sync orchestrator (engine/internal/syncrun): source-agnostic runner driving full-load (chunk plan + resume) → incremental (cursor watermark) → CDC group (anchor→backfill→stream) through the SDK facets; consumer-side `Writer`/`StreamWriter` interface with **write-ahead `Flush` discipline** (rows durable before every state-commit boundary — ack-before-state); interim **NDJSON writer** (Parquet lands in 2.5, same interface); emits JSONL v1 events (sync_started/stream_*/chunk_completed/state_advanced/checksum_computed×2/sync_finished) with source+dest row digests seeding the diff badge. CLI verbs wired to real impls: spec→registry Spec JSON, check→connector Check, discover→catalog JSON, sync→orchestrator (backfill/verify remain stubs → 2.7/2.8). Fake-connector unit suite proves full-load+matching-checksums, **crash-resume without dup/loss**, incremental-past-cursor, CDC backfill+op-types. make check green (lint 0, vet clean, -race pass).
- [ ] 2.4 MySQL connector (Tier A): full load + binlog CDC (maintained Go binlog library)
- [ ] 2.4b Family variants (A-Compatible): PG family (Aurora-PG, CockroachDB, TimescaleDB, AlloyDB, YugabyteDB), MySQL family (MariaDB, Aurora-MySQL, Percona, TiDB, Vitess) — presets, quirks, capability decls, smoke tests
- [ ] 2.4c MongoDB connector (Tier B): _id-range full load, incremental, change-stream CDC + [BRAINSTORM] BSON→lake mapping
- [ ] 2.4d MSSQL connector (Tier B): keyset full load, incremental, change-table polling CDC w/ fallback
- [ ] 2.4e Kafka source (Tier B): bounded-offset incremental, JSON/Avro decoding, offset state
- [ ] 2.4f Tier C factory via SUBAGENTS: Oracle, DB2, ClickHouse, Cassandra/Scylla, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, Redis, SQLite, Object Storage (S3/GCS/Azure/MinIO) — each reviewed vs make check + smoke tests before merge
- [ ] 2.5 Writers: Parquet first (rock solid); Iceberg per Phase 1 brainstorm decision
- [ ] 2.6 Schema handling: discovery, evolution events, per-column source→dest mapping (feeds lineage)
- [ ] 2.7 Checksum & count instrumentation + `lsengine verify` with PK-range bisection drill-down
- [ ] 2.8 Backfill/point-in-time resync (PK range / time window / changed-since-T), state-safe + [BRAINSTORM] merge strategy
- [ ] 2.9 Test harness: deploy/test-compose.yml, compose profiles, tiered batteries (A full / A-compat smoke / B / C), badge↔battery mapping in code
- [ ] 2.10 Benchmarks: script + honest measured numbers in docs/BENCHMARKS.md

## Phase 3 — Control Plane Spec & Scaffolding
- [x] docs/SPEC.md — user story + acceptance criteria + MVP/v2 label per feature
- [x] docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with mermaid diagram (system flow + data flow + decisions)
- [x] DB schema + migrations — all 21 domain tables in backend/internal/store/migrations/0001_init (embedded); applied cleanly against a real postgres:16 container (22 tables incl. schema_migrations); down migration in FK-safe order
- [x] Scaffold Go backend: cmd/lakesense (errgroup workers + graceful shutdown), internal/{config,store,api,buildinfo}; chi router w/ healthz/readyz/version; golang-migrate embedded runner; deploy/.env.example. Verified live: migrate → serve → healthz/readyz/version 200. backend added to `make check` (lint 0, vet, -race). [ ] React frontend scaffold still pending.

## Subagent Dispatch Log
- 2026-07-19: 5 read-only recon agents over reference/ (postgres, mysql, other-sources, writers, olake-ui). All 5 returned + distilled into analysis docs by main agent. None in flight.

## Decisions Log
- **2026-07-19 — v2 reset:** Working tree found with v1 artifacts deleted and `lakesense-final-prompt.md` (v2) added by the founder. Treated as intentional restart; committed as checkpoint `8ad0481`. v1 docs recoverable via git history but superseded — v2 phase structure governs.
- **2026-07-19 — [BRAINSTORM] Iceberg strategy (Phase 1):** (A) iceberg-go full integration 21 pts; (B) Parquet-only v0.1 26 pts; (C) Parquet + pure-Go append-mode Iceberg via REST catalog 31 pts. **Chose C**: default Parquet writer with our 2PC commit-marker fix; Iceberg append commits via REST catalog (Lakekeeper/Polaris class) in pure Go, no JVM; CDC-upsert Iceberg (equality deletes) honestly roadmapped v0.2; Iceberg failures degrade to Parquet + event. Full scoring table in docs/analysis/writers.md §4.
- **2026-07-19 — No Temporal:** control plane = one Go binary + Postgres; lsengine as supervised child process; cron scheduling in-process with fake-clock-testable worker. Rationale in docs/analysis/control-plane.md §6.
- **2026-07-20 — Write-ahead flush (orchestrator correctness):** while wiring the sync orchestrator, found the interim NDJSON path could record a completed-chunk / advanced-cursor / advanced-CDC-position in state while the rows were still in the bufio buffer — a crash there would lose rows the state claims are durable (Rule 6 violation). Fix: added `StreamWriter.Flush(ctx)` (bufio flush + fsync) to the Writer contract and call it at **every** state-commit boundary BEFORE the state mutation (per-chunk in full-load, before SetCursor in incremental, after backfill and after StreamChanges in CDC). This is the general ack-before-state discipline the Postgres CDC slot logic already followed, now enforced in the source-agnostic layer for all connectors and all destinations. Proven by the crash-resume unit test.
- **2026-07-20 — Command output shapes:** spec/discover print a single JSON document (schema / catalog) on stdout; check prints a human status line; data-path commands (sync/backfill/verify) emit the JSONL event stream. Keeps each command's stdout coherent for its consumer. Discover does NOT inject `_ls_` metadata columns into the catalog — those are engine-internal and injected at write time (dataColumns excludes them from checksums anyway).

## Next Action
2.4 MySQL connector (Tier A) in engine/internal/connectors/mysql: full load (keyset chunking) + incremental cursor + binlog CDC via a **maintained Go binlog library as a go.mod dependency** (clean-room Rule 3 — library dep OK, no reference application code). Implement sdk.Connector + FullLoader + IncrementalReader + ChangeStreamer to the same contract Postgres passes; register in internal/connectors/registry.go; env-gated integration suite (`LAKESENSE_MYSQL_IT=1`) mirroring the Postgres battery (check/discover, full-load exactly-once, incremental-past-cursor, CDC insert/update/delete + resume). Design first from docs/analysis/mysql-connector.md (snapshot+binlog-position coordination, GTID vs file:pos). make check green + commit.
